## Weather Checker
#### A detailed weather checker that reports the latest forecasts for any city. Built in 2018 for my high school programming club.

## How it works
Weather Checker is an Android app that uses Gson to parse JSON responses from OpenWeatherMap's API. To do this, it needs an API key to send along with every request. It then uses Android's TableLayout and ScrollView to display the weather forecasts. Weather indicator icons are also retrieved as a Bitmap from the API and loaded into the application using the Picasso image library.
